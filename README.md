Order summary card solution

### Screenshot

![](./screenshots/desktopPreview.png)
![](./screenshots/mobilePreview.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

The process was simple! 

-I started with getting set up with the style guide
-next is to create elements inside the index.html, and immediately styling the element. 
-Note: when I got stuck I simply moved on to next element and sometimes looked for helpful resources on the internet. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
